<h2>  Tesla's Inventions and Accomplishments
</h2>

<div="tribute-info"> 
  
<p><strong>The Earthquake Machine:</strong> In 1898, Tesla claimed he had built and deployed a small oscillating device that, when attached to his office and operating, nearly shook down the building and everything around it. Realizing the potential terrors such a device could create, Tesla said he took a hammer to the oscillator to disable it, instructing his employees to claim ignorance to the cause of the tremors if asked.</p>
  
<p><strong>Alternating current:</strong> In his rivalry with Thomas A. Edison, Tesla invented the electric motor, theorized and promoted the use of alternating current electric power and demonstrated it could be used safely.</p> 
  
<p><strong>Hydropower: </strong>George Westinghouse used Tesla's patents to create hydroelectric power generation at Niagara Falls.</p>
  
<p><strong>Radio and television: </strong>In 1891 Tesla invented a transformer for the production of high frequency and high voltage electricity. The Tesla coil is used in every radio and television.</p>
  
<p><strong>Remote control: </strong>He won a patent dealing with the remote control by radio of moving vessels and vehicles, laying the groundwork for wireless telemechanics, robotics and satellite communication.</p>
  
<p><strong>Radar: </strong>The people who built the first primitive RADAR units in 1934 were following principals, mainly regarding frequency and power level, that were first established by Tesla in 1917.</p>  
  
  
 <p><strong>X-rays:</strong> German physicist Willhelm Röntgen is credited widely with the discovery of X-rays in 1895, but Tesla's own experiments highlighted some of the inherent dangers of using radiation on human flesh.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Robotics: </strong>Tesla imagined that, in the future, a race of robots would be able to perform labor safely and effectively.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tesla Coil: </strong>Developed in 1891, the Tesla coil was used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla used this device in different configurations to conduct innovative experiments in his development of many other inventions.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Polyphase Induction Motors: </strong>Nikola Tesla conceived the basic principals of the polyphase induction motor in 1883, and had a half horsepower (400 watt) model by 1888. Most AC motors are induction motors. Induction motors are favored due to their ruggedness and simplicity. In fact, 90% of industrial motors are induction motors.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Death Ray:</strong>Tesla debunked any kind of "ray" weapon, but instead postulated what could be considered a lazer. "My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind."</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tesla Motors: </strong>Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla, the inventor who inspired the company’s name.</p>
